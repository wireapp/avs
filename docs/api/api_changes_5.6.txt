Changes introduced in AVS 5.6
=============================

Some tidying up is being done, removal of unused/deprecated functions:

On iOS the setMute and muted methods have been removed from AVSFlowManager. wcall_get_mute and wcall_set_mute are a better alternative.


In order to improve UX we have added an additional network quality value:
#define WCALL_QUALITY_NETWORK_PROBLEM 4
This is set in the network quality callback if the local side has no relay candidate, and audio has not been established.

The group_changed_handler's json "aestab" parameter can now take on multiple values:

    /* Audio is in the proess of connecting */	
    #define WCALL_AUDIO_STATE_CONNECTING       0
    /* Audio has been established -- audio media flowing */	
    #define WCALL_AUDIO_STATE_ESTABLISHED      1
    /* No relay candidate -- audio MAY still connect */	
    #define WCALL_AUDIO_STATE_NETWORK_PROBLEM  2 

Previously this parameter was just a 0 or 1 value indicating if audio is established or not. The NETWORK_PROBLEM value indicates a missing relay candidate, however calls may still connect, and transition into ESTABLISHED state.

We envision that the participant "spinner" is displayed while the state is CONNECTING, and a problem indicator when state is NETWORK_PROBLEM.

The wcall_member struct has similarly been updated with an audio_state member containing the same state as above replacing audio_estab.

struct wcall_member {
	char *userid;
	char *clientid;
	int audio_state;
	int video_recv;
};

For consistency clientid param has been added to the wcall_estab_h, wcall_media_estab_h, wcall_data_chan_estabh, wcall_close_h, wcall_video_size_h, wcall_audio_cbr_change_h and wcall_network_quality_h callbacks.


typedef void (wcall_estab_h)(const char *convid,
			     const char *userid,
			     const char *clientid,
			     void *arg);

typedef void (wcall_media_estab_h)(const char *convid,
				   void *peer,
				   const char *userid,
				   const char *clientid,
				   void *arg);

typedef void (wcall_data_chan_estab_h)(const char *convid,
				       const char *userid,
				       const char *clientid,
				       void *arg);

typedef void (wcall_close_h)(int reason,
			     const char *convid,
			     uint32_t msg_time,
			     const char *userid,
			     const char *clientid,
			     void *arg);

typedef void (wcall_video_size_h)(int w,
				  int h,
				  const char *userid,
				  const char *clientid,
				  void *arg);

typedef void (wcall_audio_cbr_change_h)(const char *userid,
					const char *clientid,
					int enabled,
					void *arg);

typedef void (wcall_network_quality_h)(const char *convid,
				       const char *userid,
				       const char *clientid,
				       int quality, /*  WCALL_QUALITY_ */
				       int rtt, /* round trip time in ms */
				       int uploss, /* upstream pkt loss % */
				       int downloss, /* dnstream pkt loss % */
				       void *arg);
