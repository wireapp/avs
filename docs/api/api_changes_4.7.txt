Changes introduced in AVS 4.7
=============================

We've added a new video state:

WCALL_VIDEO_STATE_SCREENSHARE = 4

that comes from wcall_video_state_change_h when the other side is screensharing, also in the wcall_member struct for group calls. Should be handled the same as WCALL_VIDEO_STATE_STARTED or screensharing may no longer work.

iOS AVSVideoRenderer has a property fillRatio to set the minimum ratio to always fill, < 1.0 means disabled, maybe a good place to start tweaking is 1.1

Android VideoRenderer has a function void setFillRatio(float ratio) to do the same as fillRatio on iOS
