Changes introduced in AVS 5.2
=============================

A new function has been added to get the AVS library version at runtime. This can be used
as a more reliable way than looking at what was requested during build time.

const char *wcall_library_version(void);

-----

A new function has been added that sets a proxy for the AVS media transport.

int wcall_set_proxy(const char *host, int port);
