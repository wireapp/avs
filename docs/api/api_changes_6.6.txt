Changes introduced in AVS 6.6
=============================

In order to facilitate the indication of an active speaker, the following API has been added.

First, register a acitve speaker change callback by using:

void wcall_set_active_speaker_handler(WUSER_HANDLE wuser,
				      wcall_active_speaker_h *activeh);

The signature of the callback needs to conform to:
typedef void (wcall_active_speaker_h)(WUSER_HANDLE wuser,
				      const char *convid,
				      const char *json_levels, void *arg);

The string json_levels will be a sorted json array in order of audio level.
With highest levels first.

Something along these lines:
{
  "audio_levels": [
    {"userid": "486cca25-8aa5-40a9-9844-3fc834857200", "clientid": "c80ae41dbc938c69", "audio_level": 106},
    {"userid": "12345678-abcd-1234-4567-1234567890ab", "clientid": "1234567890abcdef", "audio_level": 22},
    ...
  ]
}

The active speaker callback will be called everytime the order in the list of
active speakers changes. It will not be called on individial audio_level changes,
if the order in the list remains the same.
