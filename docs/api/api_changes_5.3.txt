Changes introduced in AVS 5.3
=============================

In order to support users joining group calls from multiple clients at the same time, the clientid has been added to the video renderers.

On iOS you now need to set the clientid as well as the userid:

@interface AVSVideoView : UIView
...
@property (copy) NSString *userid;
@property (copy) NSString *clientid;
...

On Android the clientid has been added as an extra parameter to the constructor of the AVSVideoView

class VideoRenderer {
	public VideoRenderer(Context context, String userId, String clientId, boolean rounded);
...
}

The wcall_stats and wcall_debug functions were updated to accept a WUSER_HANDLE instead of void*:

int  wcall_debug(struct re_printf *pf, WUSER_HANDLE wuser);
int  wcall_stats(struct re_printf *pf, WUSER_HANDLE wuser);
