Changes introduced in AVS 5.1
=============================

The void pointers representing wuser instances have been replaced with a handle:

#define WUSER_HANDLE uint32_t
#define WUSER_INVALID_HANDLE ((WUSER_HANDLE)0)

Note that the handle is now 32 bits, whereas the pointer was typically 64 bits and that NULL has been replaced with a define INVALID_HANDLE.

This handle is used everywhere the void* was used before, both in functions and callbacks, for example:

typedef void (wcall_shutdown_h)(WUSER_HANDLE wuser, void *arg);

WUSER_HANDLE wcall_create(const char *userid, ...

-----

The video state change handler now includes the conversation and client ids, note the first param is now convid, not userid:

typedef void (wcall_video_state_change_h)(const char *convid, 
					  const char *userid,
 					  const char *clientid,
 					  int state,
 					  void *arg);

-----

It is now possible to set and get the mute state via the wcall API. Also, a new (optional) mute handler callback is available, to tell you when the mute state has changed:

int wcall_get_mute(WUSER_HANDLE wuser);
void wcall_set_mute(WUSER_HANDLE wuser, int muted);

typedef void (wcall_mute_h)(int muted, void *arg);
void wcall_set_mute_handler(WUSER_HANDLE wuser, wcall_mute_h *muteh, void *arg);

-----

The group call member handler is being replaced with a handler that provides a json string for the participant list instead of a C struct. This also removes the need to free the list after use. The old version is still present but will later be removed:

typedef void (wcall_participant_changed_h)(const char *convid,
 					   const char *mjson, void *arg);
void wcall_set_participant_changed_handler(WUSER_HANDLE wuser,
 					   wcall_participant_changed_h *chgh,
 					   void *arg);

-----

wcall_init takes a new parameter, env, which should be WCALL_ENV_DEFAULT for all platforms except for Firefox:

#define WCALL_ENV_DEFAULT 0
#define WCALL_ENV_FIREFOX 1

int wcall_init(int env);
